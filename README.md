Style and enhance the functionality of the Apache directory view!  This adds HTML via PHP, styling with CSS (or LESS) and functionality with JS/ECMA (and jQuery).  Currently features enable full row highlighting and clicking.  Description row is enabled but hidden via CSS, it’s used to get the HTML Titles of files via Apache ‘ScanHTMLTitles’ feature; mouse over HTML file in the directory to see its title.  Simply adjust your httpd.conf to reflect 'Example_httpd.conf'.  Download all the files in ‘index-style’ and adjust paths accordingly (Currently set to ‘E:\~Config\index-style’).  An example ‘Screenshot.png’ is attached.
